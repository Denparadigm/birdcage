"""
Lambda calculus is a formal system developed in the 1930s by Alonzo Church to investigate the foundations of
mathematics and computability. It is a system for representing and manipulating functions, and it has become an
important tool in the study of theoretical computer science and programming language theory.

The lambda calculus is based on the idea of using anonymous functions, which are functions that do not have a name.
Instead of naming a function and defining it explicitly, a lambda expression defines a function by specifying its
inputs and outputs. A lambda expression has the form "Î»x.e", where "x" is a variable and "e" is an expression that
uses "x".

Lambda calculus provides a way to formally define and reason about computations and the behavior of functions. It is
used in the design of programming languages and in the development of algorithms for various computational problems.
The lambda calculus is also the basis of functional programming, a programming paradigm that emphasizes the use of
functions as the primary means of computation.
